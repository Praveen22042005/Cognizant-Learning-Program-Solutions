# Lab 3: Using EF Core CLI to Create and Apply Migrations 
## Scenario: 
The retail store's database needs to be created based on the models you've defined. 
Youâ€™ll use EF Core CLI to generate and apply migrations. 
## Objective: 
Learn how to use EF Core CLI to manage database schema changes. 
### Steps: 
### 1. Install EF Core CLI (if not already): 
```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```
### 2. Create Initial Migration: 
```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```
This generates a Migrations folder with code that represents the schema. 
### 3. Apply Migration to Create Database: 
```
dotnet ef database update
```
### 4. Verify in SQL Server: 
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio and confirm 
that tables Products and Categories are created.
