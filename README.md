# Cognizant Learning Program Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the Cognizant Learning Program Solutions. I created this repo to keep track of my progress and share my journey as I worked through the various learning modules and assignments provided by Cognizant. Here’s a little bit about what you’ll find here and what I’ve accomplished so far.

## What I’ve Done

- **Solved Assignments**: I’ve completed and uploaded solutions for all the assignments and challenges from the Cognizant Learning Program. Each solution is written and organized by module/topic for easy reference.
- **Organized by Modules**: The repo is structured by module, so you can easily find solutions for specific topics. I made sure to comment and explain the code wherever possible.
- **Learned New Concepts**: Throughout this journey, I learned a ton – from basic programming fundamentals to more advanced topics, depending on the module.
- **Documented My Thought Process**: I’ve added notes and explanations alongside my code to help others (and my future self!) understand how I approached and solved each problem.
- **Continuous Updates**: As I progressed through the program, I kept updating the repository with new solutions and notes.

## Why I Made This Repo

I wanted a single place where I could:

- Track my learning progress
- Refer back to my solutions when needed
- Help others who might be going through the same program
- Showcase my commitment to learning and problem-solving
